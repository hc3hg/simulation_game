The simple coin game under investigation in this paper is a two-player game involving a 6-sided die and 10 coins. To setup the game, each player would take 4 coins into their “hand” and place the remaining 2 coins in a central “pot.” One “cycle” of the game consists of Player A, and then Player B, rolling the die and taking an action that corresponds to the result of the die roll. If the player rolls a 1, they do nothing. The player gains all coins in the pot, or half the coins in the pot (rounded down) if they roll a 2 or 3 respectively. The player puts 1 coin in the pot if they roll a 4, 5, or 6. The game ends if two conditions are satisfied: a player rolls a 4, 5, or 6 AND the player has no coins remaining in his or her hand.
The objective of this paper is to determine the expected number of cycles the game will last for. First, we will outline the methodology of the R code used to calculate the expected value. Next, we will highlight the main findings of the program. Then, we will discuss the distribution of multiple replications of the game, as well as analyze potential fits of well-known probability distributions. Finally, we will discuss further applications and implications of the work done in this project.
